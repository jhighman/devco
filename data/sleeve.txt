The summer the horizon kept catching fire, a gold-thread emblem surfaced—stitched on sleeves, chalked on sidewalks, pressed into the city’s bruised skin. People noticed, then looked away. Rumors said: see it, owe something back.Pop Song Summer is a luminous, nerve-tight novel-in-stories about a city choosing its future. A night-shift stringer marked by a gold-thread sunburst sells tragedies to screens. A painter keeps two lives in one room. A rink DJ bends time with a record. A woman in red arrives just before everything tilts. Their lives cross in glances—on midnight bridges, in dead malls, at floodlit fairgrounds—until a single night at the glowing fairgrounds forces a reckoning with what to keep and what to return.Beneath the neon and smoke: love that survives evacuation, secrets water can’t unearth, a city humming a chorus you already know. Haunting and propulsive, Pop Song Summer blends the charge of a thriller with the afterglow of literary fiction—a kaleidoscope of human stakes where every choice is a door, every door opens somewhere unintended, and breaking the wall is the only way through.What you choose is yours to choose.
Return what isn’t yours.
Keep what keeps you.
