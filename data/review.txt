In Pop Song Summer, a City Learns the Discipline of Return

The summer the horizon keeps catching fire, a gold-thread sun begins to appear—stitched to sleeves, chalked onto sidewalks, stamped on stray tickets as if the city were being quietly inventoried. That emblem, with its tidy twelve rays, is the hinge on which Pop Song Summer turns: a novel-in-stories that treats symbols like receipts, cities like choirs, and choice as the only credible apocalypse.

Structured as a mixtape of linked tales, Pop Song Summer avoids the continuity traps of many “mosaic” novels. Each piece stands alone in voice and stakes—a night-shift stringer photographing a body bag, a painter with two lives layered under an overpass, a roller-rink DJ who discovers a white-label record that bends time, a pirate broadcaster whose most powerful program is silence—yet the stories accrue into a single, satisfying cadence. The effect is less episodic than symphonic. Refrains recur (a blind man’s unrecordable song; a woman in a red coat arriving a beat before disaster; a storage unit, 413, lit by twelve candles “like a clock that refuses to tell time”), and with each return they mean more.

If that sounds precious, the writing isn’t. The prose has neon bite—lyrical but wired, closer to Jennifer Egan’s Goon Squad circuitry and Emily St. John Mandel’s poised end-times than to dreamy fabulism. Scenes are shot through with tactile, grungy particulars: “a motel where the ice machine died,” “a diner promising PIE THAT FORGIVES,” a fairground ferris wheel described as “a rib cage waiting for a first inhale.” The book’s city—unnamed, plausibly American—never lapses into generic backdrop; it mutates under weather, rumor, and ritual until it feels like a living interlocutor. Don DeLillo taught us the poetry of systems; this author answers with the morality of logistics. Who moves. Who returns. Who keeps.

The governing ethic is voiced in a mantra that threads the collection: “Return what isn’t yours. Keep what keeps you.” It’s a gorgeous little koan, and the book tests it across registers—intimate, civic, metaphysical. When the stringer pockets an explanation he hasn’t earned, the world right-sizes him; when the roller-rink finally drops the “Disco Time Machine” 12-inch and the room warms into 1985, the thrill costs exactly as much as nostalgia should. Even the red-coated figure—less character than psychopomp—refuses to resolve into allegory. She is not an answer delivered; she is the bill come due.

What elevates Pop Song Summer beyond concept is its instinct for human scale. The romantic chapters (“Burning Houses in the Distance,” “Second Lover, Over and Under”) give the collection a heat source, testing devotion against evacuation orders and the gravity of secrets. The best set pieces—an orchestrated, near-mystical bridge crossing; a corner poet coaxing passersby into accidental congregation; the fairground finale where a literal wall fissures—work because they hinge on micro-decisions: the handing over of a ticket, the refusal to pocket a flyer, a single honest name spoken out loud. The apocalypse here is “background radiation.” The foreground is the moral economy of a neighborhood.

The voice is a weapon. Sentences lean forward; images click into place with reporterly precision; humor escapes at smart angles. Consider the way the book uses technology to cue era without elbowing you—landlines that “start ringing again” when time pitches up a few percent; a dead mall’s neon sign flickering back phantom letters; a radio station that “plays a blank tape and the city hears itself.” Even the kitsch is purposeful. A chalk sun shows up so often it should curdle into motif fatigue; instead it becomes the book’s emotional barometer. When a child adds a thirteenth ray—because children are always annotating our rules—you feel both the trespass and the hope.

If there’s a seam showing, it’s the occasional insistence on its mantra. A lesser writer would italicize the idea until it sags; this one mostly trusts readers to do the math. Still, one or two chapters announce their thesis a beat early, and a couple of closing buttons land with the tidy glow of a curtain call. These are small quibbles in a book that otherwise respects ambiguity. The emblem’s origin is never fully explained—blessedly. The blind man’s song remains unrecordable—correctly. Rituals work here not because the novel hand-waves them into magic, but because people agree, for a minute, to behave as if they do. Community, in other words, is the only supernatural on offer.

Comparisons are clarifying: you’ll hear echoes of Station Eleven in the book’s gentle refusal to fetishize catastrophe, of Egan in its time-hops and pop-cultural intelligence, of Paul Auster in its urban coincidences and recurrences. But Pop Song Summer feels like its own weather system—less dystopia than civic fable, less “playlist novel” than moral thriller. It asks a simple, difficult question: in a city that keeps the ledger, what do you owe the light you’ve borrowed?

The answer the book proposes is not punitive. It’s participatory. By the time we arrive at the midnight fairgrounds—twelve doors, a wall that finally cracks—the payoff is earned not by mystery solved but by nerve tested. The final image is not of ruin; it’s of exits chosen, together, chorus first.

Bestsellers are often described as “unputdownable” when what we really mean is “compulsively engineered.” Pop Song Summer is something rarer: a page-turner that leaves you wanting to stand still for a second and listen as your street answers back. It lingers—not as puzzle, but as practice. You put the book down and find yourself resisting small thefts, returning small graces. If a novel can change the way you treat a flyer on a pole, a circle of chalk at your feet, or the voice singing at a bridge—you keep it. And you return what isn’t yours.
