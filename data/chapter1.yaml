    text: "The city is a cancer of glass and LED, and tonight it hums like a broken amp. Down on 14th, the traffic's jammed with rideshare drones and guys selling knockoff pills out of the hoods of parked cars. Everybody's tuned into their own soundtrack, little earbuds whispering Top 40 like prayers to gods who died in the eighties. The skyline flickers in glitches, as if reality itself is buffering."

    text: "And tucked between two shuttered bodegas is a velvet curtain. No sign, no door, just this blood-colored fabric swaying like it's breathing. Behind it, bass leaks out in subsonic pulses. It's the kind of bass that rewrites your heartbeat whether you want it or not.\n\nI push through."

    text: "The air inside is thick, like the club is running on oxygen siphoned from another dimension. Lights move in lazy strobes, purple and gold, spilling over a floor that's already slick with sweat. There's no bar, no menu, just shadows that sell you what you want if they decide you're worth the bother.\n\nAnd then there are the dancers."

    text: "Velvet on their skin, velvet in their movements, velvet like the smooth part of a blade before the edge cuts. They move as if they're running a program: flawless, slow, then impossibly fast. Every single one of them wears the same patch stitched near the shoulder — a circle with sunrays stitched in gold thread. The insignia.\n\nThey don't look at you. They look through you, like you're another light on the floor, one more pattern in the algorithm."

    text: "In the corner, a blind man sings. No mic, no amp, just raw voice cut against the bass. He's chanting words like they're half-forgotten scripture, or maybe the last pirate broadcast before the collapse:"
    quote: "She comes, she comes… burning houses in the distance. Lights up the night. She comes."
    text_after: "Nobody claps. Nobody even reacts. The crowd moves in sync, eyes half-lidded, as though they're hypnotized. Like they already know the words. Like they were born knowing."

    text: "That's when I see her.\n\nShe's in red. Not neon red, not digital red — real red, the kind that stains. Her dress is cut from velvet so dark it looks wet. Same sun insignia stitched into the fabric. She's not one of the dancers, though. She moves against the rhythm, like she's inside her own soundtrack. And when she locks eyes with me, it feels less like attraction and more like conscription.\n\nShe doesn't ask. She just takes my hand."

    text: "Her fingers are cold, but not corpse cold — cold like the first second of an ice cube against skin, the kind that burns after. She pulls me through the moving bodies. Deeper. Back through a hallway lined with mirrors that don't reflect right. In one, I'm younger. In another, I'm someone else entirely.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" I ask.\n\nShe doesn't answer."

    quote: "Pop song summer. Velvet dancers. Insignia of the sun."
    text_after: "The hallway splits into three. She doesn't hesitate, pulls me left. The music distorts here — like cassette tape warping, like turntables melting under too much heat. Smells like ozone and perfume, a cocktail that says you're too far in to walk back."

    text: "And then we're in the back room.\n\nIt looks like a church, if the architects were high on disco and conspiracy theory. Columns of light instead of stone, a floor that ripples under your feet like water. At the center: a circle, burned into the ground, glowing faint red.\n\nThe dancers are here too. More of them. Moving slower now, almost ritualistic. The insignia on their clothes glows like it's alive.\n\nI pull my hand free. \"What is this?\"\n\nShe finally speaks, voice low, like someone reading a poem to the apocalypse.\n\n\"This is where she comes.\"\n\n\"Who's she?\"\n\nHer smile is too sharp to be warm. \"You'll see.\""

    text: "And then the floor pulses. Once, twice, syncing with my heartbeat. The dancers accelerate, spinning faster than physics should allow, velvet blurring into streaks of blood and shadow.\n\nThe blind man's voice isn't in the room, but I still hear it. Inside my skull:"
    quote: "She comes. Out to the other side. Into the pop song summer."

    text: "\"Fine,\" I say, and take the patch. It's heavier than it looks. I press it against my shoulder, and it burns through my shirt, fusing to skin. I gasp, but the pain is gone as quickly as it came.\n\nThe woman in red steps back. \"Now you're one of us.\"\n\nThe dancers stop. All at once. They turn to look at me, and for the first time, I see their eyes clearly. They're normal eyes. Human eyes. But they're all looking at something beyond me."

    text: "The circle on the floor cracks open. Light pours out, not like stage lights or LEDs, but like sunlight through stained glass. It's too bright to look at directly, but I can't look away.\n\nAnd then she's there.\n\nI can't describe her face. It shifts too fast, like flipping through radio stations. But she's beautiful in a way that hurts. She's wearing a dress made of summer itself — the kind of summer you remember from childhood, all endless days and popsicle-stained fingers.\n\nThe dancers bow. The woman in red bows. I find myself bowing too, though I didn't mean to.\n\nShe speaks, and her voice is a pop song I've heard a thousand times but can never remember the name of:"

    text: "I find my voice. \"Yes.\"\n\nShe smiles, and it's like watching the sun rise over a world that's never seen daylight before. She extends her hand, and there's a key in it. Old brass, worn smooth from use.\n\n\"Then take this. Find the door.\"\n\nI take the key. It's hot, like the patch was, but I don't drop it."

Their patches glow brighter, pulsing in time with mine.\n\nThe woman in red is watching me, her eyes reflecting the light from the circle. \"It's starting,\" she says. \"The pop song summer.\"\n\nThe blind man's voice rises again, but now it's coming from everywhere:"

Not the club, not the city. Something golden and endless.\n\nShe — the woman from the circle, the one made of summer — is gone. But her voice lingers:"
    quote: "The key fits the door. The door leads to summer. Will you come?"
    text_after: "I look at the woman in red. \"What's on the other side?\"\n\nShe shrugs. \"I've never gone through. I just bring people to her. That's my job.\"\n\nThe key burns hotter in my palm. The patch on my shoulder pulses like a second heart."
