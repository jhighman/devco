    bio:
      - "In the void between digital and analog, we emerged. Not as musicians, but as anomalies in the system. Our soundâ€”a glitch in the matrix of conventional music."
      - "We don't create; we compile. We don't perform; we execute. Each track is an algorithm of emotion, each beat a binary pulse of existence."
      - "The future isn't coming. It's compiling in our studio, one error message at a time."
